1. **Store Data**: All the information about the books, students, and borrowing history is stored in Snowflake.
2. **Access Data**: The librarian can easily access this information from any computer using the internet.
3. **Run Queries**: The librarian can run queries to find out which books are currently borrowed, who borrowed them, and when they are due back.
4. **Analyze Data**: The librarian can also analyze the data to see which books are the most popular and need to be reordered.

1. **Flexibility**: Snowflake can handle different types of data, whether it’s structured (like tables) or semi-structured (like JSON files).
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple users can access and work with the data at the same time, making it great for teamwork.
