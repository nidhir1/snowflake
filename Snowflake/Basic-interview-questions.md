## Basic Interview Questions:

#### QUES 1: What is Snowflake? What are the essential features of Snowflake?
##### Answer: Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that separates compute from storage, allowing users to scale their processing resources and data storage independently. This process is more cost-effective and produces high performance.


Features of Snowflake:
* Automatic Scaling/Elasticity: Snowflake’s architecture allows for dynamic scaling of both compute and storage resources. It can automatically scale up or down based on workload requirements, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
* Separation of Compute and Storage: Snowflake separates the storage and compute layers, enabling independent scaling of both components. This flexibility allows businesses to scale compute resources for high-demand workloads without affecting storage and vice versa.
* Native Support for Semi-structured Data: Snowflake natively supports semi-structured data formats like JSON, Avro, and Parquet, which eliminates the need for pre-processing before ingestion.
* Zero Management: Snowflake is a fully managed service, meaning that it takes care of database management tasks like indexing, tuning, and partitioning, reducing administrative overhead.
* Concurrency: Snowflake can handle multiple concurrent users and workloads without impacting performance, thanks to its multi-cluster architecture.
* Data Sharing: Snowflake allows businesses to securely share data in real-time across different organizations without the need to replicate or move the data, enhancing collaboration.
* Security and Compliance: Snowflake includes robust security measures such as encryption (at rest and in transit), role-based access control (RBAC), multi-factor authentication, and compliance with standards like HIPAA and PCI DSS.
* Time Travel: Allows you to access historical data (up to 90 days) using AT or BEFORE clause.
* Zero-copy cloning: Creates a copy of database/table without duplicating the data — fast and storage-efficient.

#### Ques2:	What are Virtual Warehouses in Snowflake?
##### Virtual Warehouses are the compute resources used to perform all DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations, such as:
*	Querying data
*	Loading data
*	Unloading data
*	Cloning
*	Creating tables/views
* They do not store data — storage is separate.Instead, warehouses handle computation and processing.

##### Key Points:
* Dedicated compute clusters that can be started, stopped, and resized independently.

* Each warehouse consists of a cluster of servers running in the cloud.

* Warehouses are independent of storage, allowing scalable compute without impacting data storage.

* They enable concurrent query execution by isolating workloads across multiple warehouses.

* You pay for the compute resources (credits) only when warehouses are running.

* Warehouses can be configured for auto-suspend and auto-resume to save costs.

| Feature     | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Perform all compute operations          |
| Scalability | Independently sized and scaled          |
| Isolation   | Separates workloads to avoid contention |
| Cost        | Pay per use while warehouse is running  |

##### Interview Tip:
* Think of virtual warehouses as Snowflake’s “compute engines” that power your data workloads with flexibility and elasticity.

#### 2.	What is a Snowflake Schema?
##### A Snowflake Schema is a type of data warehouse schema design that is a normalized version of a star schema. In a snowflake schema:
*	Dimension tables are split into multiple related tables (normalized).
*	This creates a "snowflake" shape in the ER diagram — hence the name.
##### 🧱 Structure of a Snowflake Schema
*	Fact Table (central): Contains measurable, quantitative data (e.g., sales amount, revenue).
*	Dimension Tables (surrounding): Describe the context (e.g., customer, product, time).
*	Each dimension may have sub-dimensions, which leads to a multi-level structure.

#### Ques 3.	Difference between Database, Schema, and Table in Snowflake?
##### These are hierarchical structures used to organize and manage data in Snowflake.

| **Component** | **Description**                                                            | **Example**                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Database**  | Top-level container in Snowflake. It groups schemas together.              | `SALES_DB`                      |
| **Schema**    | A logical grouping of database objects like tables, views, functions, etc. | `PUBLIC`, `RAW_DATA`, `STAGING` |
| **Table**     | Stores actual data in rows and columns. Defined inside a schema.           | `CUSTOMERS`, `ORDERS`           |


📘 Hierarchy
 Database  →  Schema  →  Table

	
#### Ques 4.	What is Fail-safe in Snowflake?
##### Fail-safe in Snowflake is a 7-day period after the Time Travel retention period during which Snowflake can recover historical data, but only in emergencies — like system failures or accidental data loss.
________________________________________
#### 🕒 Fail-safe Lifecycle
1.	Active Data: Data is available and queryable.
2.	Time Travel Period (up to 90 days):
o	You can manually query or restore dropped/changed data using AT or BEFORE clauses.
3.	Fail-safe Period (7 days after Time Travel ends):
*	You cannot access the data directly.
*	Only Snowflake Support can recover data for disaster recovery.


#### Ques 5. What is Time Travel in Snowflake?
##### Time Travel in Snowflake is a feature that allows you to query, clone, and restore data from a previous point in time.
It’s like having a rewind button for your tables, schemas, and databases — useful for recovering from mistakes, auditing, or recreating past states of your data.
________________________________________
Key Points
1.	Purpose
o	Recover data that was deleted or modified.
o	Inspect historical versions for audits and debugging.
o	Create clones of tables/schemas/databases from a historical point.
2.	Default Retention Period
o	Standard Edition: 1 day (24 hours).
o	Enterprise Edition & above: Up to 90 days.
o	Configurable at table, schema, or database level.
3.	How it Works
o	Snowflake stores immutable micro-partitions.
o	When data changes, Snowflake doesn’t overwrite; it creates new micro-partitions and keeps old ones until the Time Travel retention expires.
o	Queries with AT or BEFORE retrieve those historical micro-partitions.
________________________________________
Example Usage
```sql
-- Query a table as it was 2 hours ago
SELECT * 
FROM SALES_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS
AT(OFFSET => -2*60*60);

-- Query table as it was before a specific timestamp
SELECT * 
FROM SALES_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS
BEFORE(TIMESTAMP => '2025-08-08 08:00:00');

-- Clone a table from 3 days ago
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS_CLONE 
CLONE SALES_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS
AT(TIMESTAMP => '2025-08-05 10:00:00');

-- Undrop a table
UNDROP TABLE SALES_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS;
```
________________________________________
Benefits
*	Accidental deletion recovery (no panic needed when someone runs DELETE without a WHERE).
*	Zero-copy cloning for testing older states   *without using extra storage.
*	Audit & compliance — see exactly what data looked like in the past.


#### Ques 6. How Does Snowflake Handle Concurrency?
##### Concurrency in Snowflake refers to the ability to handle multiple users or processes running queries simultaneously without conflicts or performance degradation.
Snowflake handles concurrency automatically and efficiently, using its multi-cluster shared data architecture.
________________________________________
✅ Key Mechanisms Snowflake Uses to Handle Concurrency
| Mechanism                                    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-Cluster Virtual Warehouses**         | Snowflake can automatically start additional compute clusters for a warehouse if many users or queries are running at once. |
| **Independent Compute & Storage**            | Since compute (virtual warehouses) and storage are separated, many users can query the same data without interfering.       |
| **Automatic Query Queuing & Load Balancing** | If all clusters are busy, queries are temporarily queued and executed once resources free up.                               |
| **Result Caching**                           | If a query has already been executed, Snowflake may return results from cache, avoiding repeated work.                      |


#### Ques 7.  What is Zero-Copy Cloning in Snowflake?
##### Zero-copy cloning is a unique Snowflake feature that allows you to create a full copy of a database, schema, or table instantly — without duplicating the actual data.
* ✅ No physical data copy = zero additional storage cost (initially)
* ✅ Fast and efficient — clones are created in seconds
* ✅ Ideal for dev, test, backup, and branching use cases
##### 🧠 How It Works
*	Clone shares the underlying storage (data blocks) with the original.
*	Any changes after cloning (in either object) are stored separately — called copy-on-write.
*	So you pay only for new or modified data, not for the full clone.
##### Limitations
*	Clone and original share the same data until modified → deleting original may affect Time Travel of the clone
*	No cross-account cloning (only within same Snowflake account)
*	Does not copy external stages or file formats.

## Intermediate interview questions in Snowflakes:

#### Ques: Explain Snowflake Architecture.

![Snowflake Architecture Explained](image.png)  
##### Snowflake Architecture Explained (Image source: [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts))


Snowflake is a cloud-native data platform built with a unique architecture that separates storage, compute, and services, enabling scalability, concurrency, and elasticity.

1. Database Storage Layer
*	Stores all data in cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage).
*	Data is automatically compressed, encrypted, and stored in immutable micro-partitions (~16 MB each).
*	Storage scales independently of compute.
*	Allows data sharing and time travel by versioning stored data.
________________________________________
2. Compute Layer (Virtual Warehouses)
*	Consists of independent, MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) clusters called Virtual Warehouses.
*	Warehouses perform all query processing: scanning, filtering, joining, aggregating.
*	Multiple warehouses can run concurrently without resource contention.
*	Warehouses can auto-scale (multi-cluster) to handle concurrency or auto-suspend/resume to optimize cost.
________________________________________
3. Cloud Services Layer
*	Manages metadata, query parsing/planning, security, authentication, transaction management, and optimizations.
*	Coordinates tasks like query compilation, result caching, and access control.
*	Handles user sessions, cloud infrastructure management, and storage management.
*	This layer is fully managed by Snowflake, transparent to users.
________________________________________
🔄 How the Layers Work Together
1.	User submits a query to Snowflake.
2.	Cloud Services layer parses and plans the query.
3.	Compute layer (virtual warehouse) executes the query by accessing data from the storage layer.
4.	Results are returned to the user, with metadata updated by Cloud Services.

#### Ques What are micro-partitions in Snowflake, and what is its contribution to the platform's data storage efficiency?
###### Micro-partitions are the fundamental unit of data storage in Snowflake. They are immutable, compressed, columnar storage files that store a subset of table data.
________________________________________
###### Key Characteristics of Micro-Partitions:
*	Size: Typically around 16 MB of uncompressed data each.
*	Columnar Storage: Data within micro-partitions is stored column-wise, optimizing compression and query performance.
*	Immutable: Once created, micro-partitions are never updated; new data writes create new micro-partitions.
*	Metadata-rich: Each micro-partition stores metadata like min/max values, distinct values, and data statistics for columns.
________________________________________
###### Contribution to Storage Efficiency and Performance:
1. Efficient Data Compression
*	Columnar format allows Snowflake to apply high compression ratios, reducing storage footprint.
2. Automatic Partitioning
*	Snowflake automatically partitions tables into micro-partitions—no manual partitioning required.
3. Pruning (Partition Elimination)
*	Query optimizer uses micro-partition metadata (min/max column values) to skip irrelevant partitions, scanning only needed data.
*	This reduces I/O and speeds up queries significantly.
4. Immutable Storage & Time Travel
*	Immutable micro-partitions enable efficient versioning for features like Time Travel and Fail-safe, allowing queries on historical data without extra storage overhead.
5. Scalable & Distributed Storage
•	Micro-partitions enable Snowflake to scale storage seamlessly on cloud object stores, distributing data efficiently.

#### Ques	How do you load data into Snowflake from AWS S3?
##### Snowflake provides multiple ways to load data from Amazon S3, but the most common and efficient approach is:
###### Step-by-Step Process
1. Create a Stage (Reference to S3 Bucket)
*	Internal Stage → Data stored in Snowflake-managed storage
*	External Stage → Points to your S3 bucket

###### CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
URL = 's3://my-bucket-name/path/'
STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_s3_integration
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' SKIP_HEADER = 1);

###### Create a Storage Integration (One-Time Setup)
This lets Snowflake access your S3 bucket securely.
```sql
CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION my_s3_integration
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my_snowflake_role'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://my-bucket-name/path/');
```
*	Then configure AWS IAM to trust Snowflake’s AWS account.
________________________________________
###### Create the Target Table in Snowflake
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales_data (
    order_id INT,
    product_name STRING,
    quantity INT,
    price FLOAT,
    order_date DATE
);
```
________________________________________
###### Load Data from S3 to the Table
```sql
COPY INTO sales_data
FROM @my_s3_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```
###### Snowflake reads the files from the S3 stage and loads them into the table. (Optional) Use Snowpipe for Continuous Loading
* If new files are regularly added to S3, set up Snowpipe for automated, near real-time ingestion:
```sql
CREATE PIPE my_pipe
AS
COPY INTO sales_data
FROM @my_s3_stage
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```
| **Step**            | **Why Important?**                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Storage Integration | Secure connection between Snowflake & AWS |
| Stage               | Acts as a pointer to the S3 location      |
| COPY INTO           | Loads data from stage to Snowflake table  |
| File Format         | Defines how files are parsed              |
| Snowpipe            | Automates incremental loading             |
